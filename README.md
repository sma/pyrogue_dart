Pyrogue in Dart
===============

This is based on an automated ChatGPT translation of [Pyrogue](https://github.com/sma/pyrogue) from Python to Dart. The very first commit is the raw translation. Further commits are my attempts to make it actually work.

Initially, there are 2K+ errors mostly because there are no imports. It took me about an hour to create this version.

I fixed all imports and all functions and variables that were named differently in different files. I also fixed some mistranslations due to tuples. ChatGPT was also not translating octal constants correctly. I spent about three hours on this.

Then, I added a simple `curses` implementation in about 20 minutes.

Last but not least, I hunted down some bugs and even found one in the 15 year old Python version. In total, I probably spent the better part of a day on this.

The game is playable but not yet bug-free.

To play, enter `dart run` on your favorite VT100 compatible terminal.

Pyrogue
=======

For fun, I ported a 20 years old clone of a nearly 30 years old computer game
called [Rogue][rogue] to Python. The C code was written by Tim Stoehr in 1986.
The Python code was written in early 2008 by me, Stefan Matthias Aust. It is
very unpythonic because it's a raw and direct port of the C code to Python
2.5.x, nothing to be particularly proud of.

It requires curses, so it probably runs only on Unix-like systems.

Screenshoots
------------

Our fearless hero (`@`) is about to climb down to level 3 of the Dungeons of
Doom, equipped with some food, a magical armor, a long sword and some unknown
magical potions. The `%` denotes the stairway.

Running the Game
----------------

	python main.py

I ported 98% of the code. The save function is missing. The code has bugs, though. 

It took me about 15 hours to rewrite 6282 lines of C code into 4065 lines of Python code and find the oversights I made.
