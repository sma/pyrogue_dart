Pyrogue in Dart
===============

This is an automatic ChatGPT translation of [Pyrogue](https://github.com/sma/pyrogue) from Python to Dart. The very first commit is the raw translation. Further commits are my attempts to make it actually work.

Initially, there are 2K+ errors mostly because there are no imports.

I fixed all imports and all functions and variables which were differently named in different files. I also fixed some mistranslations because of tuples. ChatGPT also didn't correctly translate octal constants. 

I added a simple curses implementation.

The game is playable but not yet bug-free.
